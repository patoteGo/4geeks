# `13` Image with Text

Before CSS existed, using tables was the only way possible to do some website layouts, is a very similar process to creating layouts on MS Office.

For example, to recreate this example you have to do the following:
1.Create a table with the attribute border="0"
2.Add row (tr) with 2 columns (td) inside.
3.The first column containing an image with the attribute height="150"
4.The second one with the attribute valign="top" to move the texto to the top of the cell and also add some text inside: you can use this tool to generate fake text that looks like real text: http://www.lipsum.com/

**Please follow the previous steps to recreate the example.**
