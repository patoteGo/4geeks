# `05` User Inputted Variables

The other cool thing about variables is that you don't need to know their value to be able to work with them.

For example, this application is originally prompting the user for his or her age, and then printing it on the console.


## :pencil: Instructions

* Please add 10 years to the value of the **age** variable. 


### ðŸ’¡ Hint:

* The content of the variable is the user's inputs. The prompt saves the input value as a string. You will have to make sure that the variable is converted to integer for the calculation to be correct.
