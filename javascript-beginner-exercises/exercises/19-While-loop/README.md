# `19` The WHILE Loop

This code is broken, it produces an infinite loop. Replit handles the infinite loop, for now.

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Fix the problem, to print from 100 - 0. 
* Return 0.

### :exclamation: IMPORTANT: 
*There's a Replit Classroom dedicated to Arrays, we encourage you to go and finish those after this first Array exercise. (And then, come back).*
