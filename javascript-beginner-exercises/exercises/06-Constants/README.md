# `06` Constants


Since 2015, JavaScript also allows the usage of constants. 
They differ from variables because once declared, they cannot have their values changed over time like variables can.

To declare a constant, you have to use the reserved word **const** instead of **var**, like this:

```js
const VERSION = '1.2';
```

Constants are super useful because sometimes as a developer you'd want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.
