# `14` Your First Switch Statement

Imagine your software is running the inventory of a shoe store. 
The client needs to know what colors a particular shoe is available in.

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Complete this switch statement with 3 cases for a shoe coming in 3 colors: red, green and blue.

The function needs to return **true** if the inputted color is one of the available colors above or **false** if the color is not available.

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:
* You may need to bring the user input to all lower case or all upper case to prevent discrepancies.
