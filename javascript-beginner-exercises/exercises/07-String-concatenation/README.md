# `07` String Concatenation

One of JavaScript's main objectives is to generate HTML code. 
Concatenation comes in handy because you can create and add to existing HTML strings. To concatenate strings, we use the **+** (plus) operator. 

For example:

```js
var one = 'a';
var two = 'b';
console.log(one+two); //this will print 'ab' on the console.
```

## :pencil: Instructions
* Set the values for **myVar1** and **myVar2** so the code prints **'Hello World'** in the console.
