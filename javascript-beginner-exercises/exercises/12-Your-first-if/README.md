# `12` Your First If Statement

The current application has a prompt asking how much money the user has. 


## :pencil: Instructions:
Once the user inputs the amount, we need to print one of the following answers:

* If the user has more than $100, we answer: "Give me your money!"
* If the user has more than $50, we answer: "Buy me some coffee, you cheapster!"
* If the user has less or equal than $50, we answer: "You are a poor guy, go away!"

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:
* Use an If/else statement to check the value of the "total" variable
* Print the corresponding message
