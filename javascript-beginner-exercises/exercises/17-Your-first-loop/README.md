# `17` Your First Loop

If you run this code you'll see a count from 0 to 99 (White characters).  

## :pencil: Instructions:
Fix the code so that it counts up to 100. You will then see it followed by 101 in green text in the console.

### :exclamation: IMPORTANT: 
*There is a Replit Classroom dedicated to Arrays, we encourage you to go and finish those after this first Array exercise. (And then, come back).*

**Can you fix it?**
