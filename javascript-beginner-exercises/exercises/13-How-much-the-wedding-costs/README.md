# `13` How Much the Wedding Costs


Here is the table of prices of a wedding catering company:

* Up to 50 people                     $4,000
* Up to 100 people                   $10,000
* Up to 200 people                   $15,000
* More than 200 people           $20,000

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Please write an algorithm that prompts the user for the number of people attending their wedding and prints the corresponding price in the console.

For example, if the user says that 20 people are attending the wedding, it must cost $4,000 dollars.

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:
* Use if/else to divide your code and set the value of the **price** variable correctly.
