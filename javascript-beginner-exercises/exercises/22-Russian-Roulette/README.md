# `22` Russian Roulette 

Have you ever played Russian Roulette? It's super fun! 

If you make it (wuuuahahahaha).

The revolver gun has only 6 slots for bullets. You insert one bullet in one of the slots, spin the revolver chamber to make the game random, nobody knows the bullet position.

FIRE!!!....... are you dead?

## :pencil: Instructions:
The game is almost working.
* Please fill the function **fireGun** to make the game work (compare the bullet position against the chamber position.)

### :bulb: HINT:
The function needs to return true or false depending on the result.

If the bullet was at the same slot as the revolver chamber, then it will be fired (false).
