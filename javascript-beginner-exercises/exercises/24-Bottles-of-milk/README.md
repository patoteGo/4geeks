# `24` Bottles of Milk 

Have you heard the song about 99 bottles of milk? 

It is a great song - not boring at all... :laughing: 

Here you can hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy-da43E6Lo

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Please write an algorithm to print the exact same lyrics.

### :bulb: HINT:
* At the end of the song, the lyrics change because it is only one bottle (singular instead of plural).
* Read the last lyrics and you will see how the last line changes to "go to the store and by some more".
* Use loops to complete this task

### :scroll: Note:
The result should be something like this:

99 bottles of milk on the wall, 99 bottles of milk. 
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of milk on the wall.

98 bottles of milk on the wall, 98 bottles of milk.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of milk on the wall.
...
...
1 bottle of milk on the wall, 1 bottle of milk.
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall.

No more bottles of milk on the wall, no more bottles of milk. 
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of milk on the wall.
