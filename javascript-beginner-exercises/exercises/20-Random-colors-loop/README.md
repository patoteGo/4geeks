# `20` Random Colors Loop

We have created a function that returns a color based on a number between 1 and 4 (for any different number, it will return the color black).

## :pencil: Instructions:
Let's say that we are teachers in a 10-student classroom. We want to randomly assign ONE color (red, yellow, blue or green), to EACH student. 

(only ONE color PER student)

* Change the function **getAllStudentColors** so it returns an array of 10 colors, with each item in the array representing the color assigned to each student.

### :bulb: Hint: 
- You have 10 students, you need to loop 10 times.
- Each time you loop, generate a random number between 1-4 using the **Math.random()** function which we saw on the last exercise.
- Use the **getColor** function on this exercise to get the color name from the number you get.
- Print the color on the console.

### :exclamation: IMPORTANT:
*If you feel you are not understanding looping, its a good idea to complete the Arrays Repl.it classroom and the come back here:*
