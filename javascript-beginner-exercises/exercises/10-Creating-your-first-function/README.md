# `10` Creating Your First Function

## :pencil: Instructions:

The function **addNumbers** is supposed to return the sum of 2 given numbers.
* Please complete the needed code inside of the function to make it behave as expected.

The exercise should print the number 7 in the console.

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:

The function is receiving 2 parameters (variables **a** and **b**). As a developer you were given a task to fill the function content with the code needed to sum these two variables and return the result of that operation.

### :scroll: Note:

*For practicing more with functions, there is a specific Repl.it class about functions created by 4Geeks Academy that has more than 20 incremental exercises.*
