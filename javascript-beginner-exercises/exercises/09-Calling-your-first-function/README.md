# `09` Calling Your First Function

Functions are amazing because of many things, but mainly because you can encapsulate your code in pieces and re-use those pieces several times without having to type all that code again.

### :exclamation: IMPORTANT: 

*There is a Replit Classroom dedicated to Functions, we encourage you to go and finish those after this first Function exercise. (And then, come back).*

## :pencil: Instructions

The already defined function **isOdd** returns *True* if an odd number is passed as a parameter, and *False* if the number is even. 
* Please call that function by passing the number 45345 as its parameter.
* Print the result of the function call on the console.
