# `23` The Beatles 

Who does not like The Beatles?
A BBC study has shown that 90% of kids today don't know the band.. So sad.. :worried:

Below is the chorus of one of the most famous Beatles songs:

> Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
> Whisper words of wisdom
> Let it be

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Create a function called **sing()** that returns a string with the exact same lyrics which you can hear from the 3:10 sec to the end of the song at 3:54 sec. 
Here is the expected console output: 

    'let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, words of wisdom, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, there will be an answer, let it be'

### :bulb: HINT:
* The words "let it be" repeat all the time, probably you should create a loop for that.
