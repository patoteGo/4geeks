# `09` 3D Anchor Styles

People like to feel that they are clicking on something, a great approach to accomplish that is by faking a 3D effect. To do so, designers normally play with the borders. Example:

You can control what css rules apply to each state of an anchor by using the ":hover" (for mouse hover) or ":active" (for mouse pressing) selectors, example:

```css
a:active {
  /* here you can specify whatever css rule that applies
  to the anchor while being 'pressed' */
}
```

## üìù Instructions:


1. Change the border colors of the anchor,
when being pressed, to the following:

```css
border-color: #000 #aaa #aaa #000;
```
